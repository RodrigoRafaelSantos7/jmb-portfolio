## Publications & Articles

João Maria Botelho’s written work reflects the same balance of rigour, clarity, and accessibility that defines his legal and sustainability practice. His publications range from academic contributions to widely read op-eds and essays, all driven by a single purpose: to expand literacy and shape meaningful debate on sustainability, governance, and youth leadership.

He is coordinating editor of the first comprehensive ESG handbook in Portugal, Manual de ESG – Studies on ESG: Current and Future Challenges (Almedina, 2025), a reference volume of more than 500 pages bringing together over twenty leading experts.

Beyond academic publishing, João Maria has contributed articles and opinion pieces to outlets positioning him as a recognised young voice in both the Portuguese and international public sphere.

His writing covers themes such as ESG regulation, sustainable finance, climate law, youth participation in governance, and the future of ocean governance. Whether in scholarly works or media platforms, his articles consistently bridge technical analysis with broader civic relevance.
