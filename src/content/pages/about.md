## About João Maria Botelho

João Maria Botelho belongs to a cohort of leaders who refuse to treat sustainability as a peripheral accessory to business. For him, the climate crisis is not merely an environmental challenge, but a profound social and financial frontier. His journey is defined by the unwavering conviction that Law, Finance, and Sustainability are not separate disciplines, but a single, integrated framework required to navigate the complexities of the 21st century.

Educated at the vanguard of legal innovation — **NOVA School of Law** (Portugal), where he now contributes to the Board of Alumni — João's intellectual foundation was further refined through global lenses. His expertise was sharpened at the **Wharton School** (ESG Specialization Course) and under the mentorship of **John Fullerton** in Regenerative Economics, a program he attended with full merit-based tuition, awarded in recognition of his significant contributions to the field. Currently, he is expanding his academic reach at the **NOVA School of Science and Technology (FCT)**, pursuing a postgraduate degree in Entrepreneurship and Technology to bridge the gap between rigorous legal frameworks and the cutting-edge innovations shaping the future.

The year 2024 marked his definitive ascent as a global thought leader. Recognized as a **Forbes 30 Under 30** honoree and identified by **Randstad** as one of the leading emerging voices in ESG, João's authority was further cemented when he was featured in **Forbes USA** as an expert on the evolution of EU sustainability reporting. A prolific columnist for major media outlets in both Portugal and Brazil, he has become a listened-to voice across the Atlantic, translating the legal and economic challenges of the sustainable transition for a global audience.

In the legal arena, João's practice focuses on high-stakes cross-border transactions where sustainability, regulatory frameworks, and financial structuring meet. His strategic insight is sought not only by corporations but also by the entrepreneurial ecosystem, having served as an **Advisor for Santander X**, the national startup program of the Santander Foundation. This role, coupled with his position as a **European Climate Pact Ambassador** and **TEDx speaker**, allows him to drive dialogue at the highest institutional levels while mentoring the next generation of innovators.

As an author and researcher, João Maria Botelho has reached a milestone that consolidated his standing in the Lusophone world. He is the co-coordinator and author of the **First ESG Handbook in Portugal** (Almedina), a seminal 500-page reference work — the first of its kind in Portugal — uniting over twenty experts under his vision. Far from stagnant, he is currently on a mission to deliver his second book, further exploring the relationship between regulation, capital allocation, and real-world outcomes.

Today, as a **Global Shaper** for the World Economic Forum and co-founder of the **Youth Club Portugal**, João continues to build the civic and intellectual structures he once envisioned. He is not just training the next generation of leaders; he is equipping them with the legal, financial, and technological tools required for full civic participation. His mission remains clear: to ensure that the sustainable transition is not just a policy goal, but a lived reality, driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs who lead with purpose, technical mastery, and an uncompromising spirit of innovation.

## 2019

The roots of his leadership trace back to 2019, when a historical research project recognized by the **Council of Europe** first sparked his commitment to civic engagement and democratic memory. This early encounter with institutional leadership set the stage for a trajectory that would move from the fundamental rights of the Portuguese Parliament to the high-stakes corridors of the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, and global climate summits.

## 2021 – 2023

Between 2021 and 2023, João's career took a decisive turn toward the global stage. From conducting ocean and ESG research to navigating the energy sectors of New York with **GASP** and **AAE**, he transitioned from an observer to a practitioner. During this period, he bridged the gap between startup agility and institutional rigor, serving as an **Advisor for Syntegral** (NY based Startup) in ESG and Impact Investing while simultaneously honing his legal craft at both boutique and top-tier international law firms.

His research in constitutional law, developed under the auspices of the **Portuguese Parliament**, earned him an **Honorable Mention from the President of the Assembly of the Republic** — a testament to a young jurist already capable of influencing national discourse. During this period, he was also involved with leading alignment-focused centers dedicated to human rights, environmental enhancement, the blue economy, and ESG at NOVA University.

## 2023 – 2024

The year 2023 marked a pivotal expansion of his global footprint. At **COP28** in Dubai, João founded [Generation Resonance](/generation-resonance), an international network that today empowers youth across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the United States to lead with substance. His appointment as a **Global Shaper** by the World Economic Forum solidified his role as a curator of high-level dialogues on leadership, a role he leveraged when he was named a **Forbes 30 Under 30** honoree and received the **National Award for Financial Literacy and Entrepreneurship** from the Santander Foundation.

## 2025

By 2025, João's authority reached a definitive milestone. As the coordinator and co-author of the first **Handbook in ESG** (Almedina), he led a monumental 500-page reference work — the first of its kind in Portugal — uniting over twenty experts under his vision. Now serving as the **European Climate Pact Ambassador** and a **TEDx speaker**, he has become a translator of global challenges into governance solutions.

His participation in the **Ambição Portugal** project, alongside KPMG and Expresso, saw him rethinking national ambition with leaders across four generations, reinforcing his belief that dialogue is the ultimate driver of institutional renewal.
